# In Development

# Corvus
Low-power cost-effective home security system

The user will be in a separate location with the ability to see the LCD as well as the LED indicators. Once a door/window has been opened, the corresponding LED will flash, letting the user know they need to direct their attention to the offline camera feed present on the LCD. 

# Operating Instructions 

## Installation 
The reed switches must be placed so that when the door/window is closed the switch is engaged, ideally placed in a non-obstructive location, such as the top of a door or bottom of a sliding window. 
The LED's must be placed in a location where the user will be withing viewing angle for the majority if not at all times.  
The LCD can be placed in a less obtrusive location as the LED's will be the main indicator.  

## Startup and initialization 
The user will need to launch the Arducam Multiple-Camera, as well as launch the .py file to start the system. 

## Once Deployed 
The user needs to remain in viewing angle/distance of the LEDS and when a door/window is opened they will be notified via flashing LED. 

# Further Development 
-Add speaker as well as audio alarm for an open door/window, as well as a sleep mode so the alarm is deactivated at the user's discretion 
-Record camera feed and transfer to a local hard drive 
-Add button for a door bell as well as a camera that will take priority over the others to show the main door.
